# Distributed-Database-for-E-commerce

In the proposed E-commerce distributed database, key tables
include Users, Products, Categories, Orders, OrderDetails,
Transactions, Reviews, Inventory, and Shipping, each serving a
distinct purpose. The Users table stores registered user information,
while Products and Categories manage product details and
classifications. The Orders and OrderDetails tables track user
orders and their contents, and Transactions record payment details
for each order. The Reviews table captures user feedback on
products, Inventory manages stock levels and locations, and
Shipping monitors the delivery process for orders.
