# Distributed-Database-System-Optimization

This project focuses on optimizing a distributed database system, tailored for a specific purpose. The key tables include Users, Products, Categories, Orders, OrderDetails, Transactions, Reviews, Inventory, and Shipping. Each of these tables serves a distinct purpose in our E-commerce distributed database.

## PART 3: Query Processing and Optimization Techniques

### Problem Statement

In this section of the project, our objective is to implement advanced query processing and optimization techniques to boost the performance of our distributed database system, focusing on the chosen topic.

### Techniques/Topics

- **Query Optimization:** We will carefully analyze and fine-tune queries to ensure efficient data retrieval. This will involve leveraging the features provided by our selected database system, which could be either PostgreSQL or MySQL.

- **Distributed Indexing:** We'll implement sophisticated distributed indexing strategies to enhance query performance in a distributed environment. This step is crucial for efficient data retrieval in a distributed system.

### To-do Tasks

1. **Query Optimization:**
   - We'll start by thoroughly examining the queries used in our system. Our aim is to make them as efficient as possible, taking full advantage of the capabilities provided by PostgreSQL or MySQL.

2. **Distributed Indexing:**
   - Next, we'll focus on implementing distributed indexing strategies. This involves carefully selecting and configuring indexes across our distributed database to optimize query performance.

### Deliverables

- **Code/Script:** The optimized query code and distributed indexing implementation.
- **Snapshots:** Screenshots or visual representations demonstrating the impact of our optimizations.
- **Documentation:** Detailed reports explaining our optimization techniques and indexing strategies.

### Possible Tools

You have the flexibility to choose from the following tools:

- **Option 1:** **PostgreSQL or MySQL with Query Optimization**
   - We'll be utilizing the built-in query optimization features of either PostgreSQL or MySQL to fine-tune and optimize our queries.

- **Option 2:** **Apache Calcite**
   - An open-source framework known for building custom query optimization solutions. This is an alternative option you may choose if it aligns better with your project goals.

Feel free to select any other tool that you believe is best suited for this project, provided it aligns with the project requirements.
